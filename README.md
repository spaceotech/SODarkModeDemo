## What is iOS Dark Mode? What does it do?

Dark Mode is a dark system-wide appearance that uses a darker color palette for all screens, views, menus, and controls. Basically, like Android Dark Mode, it changes a bright theme to a darker one. It also maintains vibrancy and contrast to make foreground content stand out against a darker background.


## Benefits of Dark Mode

- It is most helpful when the surrounding is dark. This puts less strain on eyes as compared to light mode. 
- You can choose Dark Mode as your default interface style.
- You can also use Settings to make your device switch to Dark Mode automatically when ambient light is low.
- Dark Mode supports all accessibility features.
